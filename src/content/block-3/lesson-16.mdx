# 🏛️ Lesson 16: The Trend Analyst – Writing Task 1 (Dynamic Data)

**Topic:** *Describing Change Over Time (Line Graphs, Bar Charts)*.
**Exam Relevance:** This is the most common task type. You must describe how numbers change over a period (e.g., 2000–2010).

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The 4-Paragraph Structure

Do not be creative. Use this fixed structure every time.

1. **Introduction (1 sentence):** Paraphrase the question. (Do not copy it!).
2. **Overview (2 sentences):** Summarize the **Main Trends**. (Do not give specific numbers here!). This is the most important paragraph for Band 7.
3. **Details Paragraph A:** Describe the first group of data (e.g., Lines that went up) with numbers.
4. **Details Paragraph B:** Describe the second group (e.g., Lines that went down) with numbers.

## 2. 🗂️ Vocabulary Box: The Movement Matrix

Stop using "went up" and "went down". Use C1 verbs and adverbs.

| Trend | Verb (Past/Pres) | Noun |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ↗️ **Big Increase** | rocketed / surged / soared | a surge / a sharp rise |
| ↘️ **Big Decrease** | plummeted / plunged | a plunge / a dramatic fall |
| ➡️ **No Change** | leveled off / stabilized / remained constant | a stabilization / a plateau |
| 〰️ **Unstable** | fluctuated | a fluctuation |

**Preposition Alert:**

* Rose **to** 10% (The final number is 10).
* Rose **by** 10% (The difference is 10. Start 5 -> End 15).

## 3. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Trend Description

### Drill 1: The Paraphrase (Introduction)

**Question:** "The graph below shows the electricity consumption in England and Germany from 1980 to 2010."

</FillBlanks>

### Drill 3: Preposition Precision

**Data:** 1990: 50 tons. 2000: 80 tons.
