# 🏛️ Lesson 22: The Storyteller – Speaking Part 2 (The Long Turn)

**Topic:** *The 2-Minute Monologue (Cue Card)*.
**Exam Relevance:** You get a topic card (e.g., "Describe a gift you received"). You have 1 minute to prepare and 2 minutes to speak.
**The Trap:** Running out of things to say after 45 seconds.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "PPF" Strategy

To fill 2 minutes, you must move through time.

1. **Past:** Context. When did it happen? What was the situation before?
2. **Present:** Description. What is happening? Details (Senses: look, feel).
3. **Future:** Reflection. How do you feel about it now? Will you keep it?

**The "W" List:** Who, What, Where, When, Why... and **How did you feel?** (Emotion adds volume).

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Note-Taking (1 Minute)

**Topic:** *Describe a difficult challenge you overcame.*

**Bad Notes:** *Math exam. Hard. Passed. Happy.* (Too simple).
**Band 8 Notes:**

* *Context:* Final year uni, pressure, stakes high.
* *Action:* Burned midnight oil, tutor, sleepless nights.
* *Result:* Aced it, relieved, proud.
* *Vocab:* "Daunting task", "Perseverance", "Paid off".

**Task:** Fill the gap in the speech.
*"At the time, passing that exam felt like a [daunting task|big job|hint:Collocation]. I had to [burn the midnight oil|study late|hint:Idiom] for weeks. But eventually, my hard work [paid off|worked|hint:Phrasal Verb]."*
