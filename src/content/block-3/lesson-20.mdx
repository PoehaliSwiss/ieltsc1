# 🏛️ Lesson 20: The Idea Factory – Generating Arguments

**Topic:** *Idea Generation Techniques*.
**Exam Relevance:** "I don't have any ideas!" is the biggest panic trigger. You don't need *brilliant* ideas; you need *relevant* ones.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "PERS" Filter

When stuck, look at the topic through these 4 lenses:

1. **P - Personal/Psychological:** How does it affect the individual? (Mental health, stress, money).
2. **E - Economic:** How does it affect money/business/jobs?
3. **R - Regional/Social:** How does it affect society/culture/families?
4. **S - State/Environment:** How does it affect the government or the planet?

**Example:** *Topic: Online Shopping.*

* **P:** Convenient for me (saves time).
* **E:** Hurts local shops (bankruptcies).
* **S:** Packaging waste (environment).

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Brainstorming

**Topic:** *Should university education be free?*

**Task:** Generate one argument for each category.

1. **Economic (State perspective):**
* *Argument:* It costs the government too much money. -> *High tax burden.*


2. **Social (Equality):**
* *Argument:* Everyone gets a chance. -> *Promotes social mobility.*


3. **Personal (The student):**
* *Argument:* Graduates have no debt. -> *Financial freedom upon graduation.*



**Task:** Turn the "Economic" argument into a Topic Sentence (C1 style).
