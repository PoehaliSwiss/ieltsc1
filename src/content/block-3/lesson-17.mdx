# 🏛️ Lesson 17: The Photographer – Writing Task 1 (Static Data)

**Topic:** *Describing Comparisons (Pie Charts, Tables)*.
**Exam Relevance:** Sometimes there is no time. You see a snapshot of *one year*. You cannot say "It increased". You must say "It is **larger than**".

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The Language of Comparison

Dynamic vocabulary (*plummet/soar*) is **forbidden** here. Nothing moves.
You need **Comparative Structures**.

* **X is twice as high as Y.**
* **X is three times the size of Y.**
* **X amounts to 50%, whereas Y accounts for only 10%.**
* **X is the dominant category.**

**Grouping Strategy:**
Do not list every number. Group them:

* *Group 1:* The Giants (The biggest slices/numbers).
* *Group 2:* The Dwarfs (The smallest numbers).

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Static Comparisons

### Drill 1: Comparative Structures

**Data:** USA (60%), China (20%).
**Task:** Compare them using the cues.

**1. (Threefold)**
<FillBlanks>
The figure for the USA is [three times higher than|threefold higher than|hint:Multiplier phrase] that of China.
</FillBlanks>

**2. (Respectively)**
The percentages for the USA and China are 60% and 20% [respectively|hint:Ordering adverb].

**3. (Whereas)**
<FillBlanks>
The USA accounts for 60% of the total, [whereas|while|hint:Contrast connector] China makes up only 20%.
</FillBlanks>

### Drill 2: "Making Up" the Whole

You need varied verbs to say "X is 50%".

* *constitute / comprise / account for / make up / represent*

**Task:** Rewrite "Cars are 40% of the total."

1. Cars [account for|hint:Verb] 40% of the total.
2. Cars [constitute|hint:Formal verb] a significant portion of the total (40%).
3. The category of cars [makes up|hint:Phrasal verb] 40%.
