# 🏛️ Lesson 19: The Strategist – Essay Types & Structures (Task 2)

**Topic:** *The 4 Main Essay Types*.
**Exam Relevance:** If you use an "Opinion Essay" structure for a "Problem/Solution" question, you will lose points for Task Response. You must identify the type instantly.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The 4 Archetypes

1. **Opinion (Agree/Disagree):** *To what extent do you agree?*
* **Structure:** Intro (Thesis) -> Body 1 (Reason 1) -> Body 2 (Reason 2) -> Conclusion. (One-sided argument is safer for Band 8).


2. **Discussion (Discuss both views):** *Discuss both views and give your opinion.*
* **Structure:** Intro -> Body 1 (View A) -> Body 2 (View B + Your Opinion) -> Conclusion.


3. **Problem / Solution:** *What are the causes and what measures can be taken?*
* **Structure:** Intro -> Body 1 (Causes) -> Body 2 (Solutions) -> Conclusion.


4. **Two-Part Question:** *Why is this happening? Is it a positive trend?*
* **Structure:** Intro -> Body 1 (Answer Question 1) -> Body 2 (Answer Question 2) -> Conclusion.



**Crucial Rule:** The Introduction and Conclusion must mirror each other. If you change your opinion in the conclusion, you lose Coherence points.

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Planning the Essay

**Task:** Read the prompt and choose the correct essay structure.

**Prompt A:** *"Some people think technology makes us less social. Others think it connects us. Discuss both views and give your opinion."*
<Quiz answer="2">

<Option>Write 2 paragraphs about why technology is bad.</Option>
<Option>Paragraph 1: Arguments for "Less Social". Paragraph 2: Arguments for "Connects us" (refuting the first view). Conclusion: Summarize.</Option>
</Quiz>

**Prompt B:** *"Traffic is a major problem in cities. What are the reasons for this? How can it be solved?"*
<Quiz answer="1">
**Structure Strategy:**

<Option>Paragraph 1: Causes (Car ownership, Poor public transport). Paragraph 2: Solutions (Congestion charge, Better trains).</Option>
<Option>Paragraph 1: Why I agree traffic is bad. Paragraph 2: Why I disagree.</Option>
</Quiz>


# 🏛️ Lesson 21: The Chameleon – Speaking Part 1 (Social)

**Topic:** *Speaking Part 1 Strategy (Fluency & Idioms)*.
**Exam Relevance:** Part 1 is a warm-up (4-5 mins). Topics are easy (Home, Work, Hobbies).
**Goal:** Show you can speak effortlessly. Do not give "Yes/No" answers.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "Answer + Extend" Formula

Never stop at the answer.

* **Question:** "Do you like sports?"
* **Band 5:** "Yes, I like football."
* **Band 8:** "Answer + Detail + Emotion/Frequency."
* *"Absolutely. I'm actually a bit of a football fanatic. I try to play at least twice a week to let off steam."*



**Idiom Alert:** Part 1 is the *safest* place to drop idioms.

* *To let off steam* (Relax).
* *Not my cup of tea* (I don't like it).
* *Once in a blue moon* (Rarely).

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Extending Answers

**Question:** "Do you work or are you a student?"
**Extension Strategy:** Say what you do + how long + opinion.

<FillBlanks>
Currently, I'm working as a software engineer. I've been [in this role|doing this|hint:Phrase] for about three years now. It can be stressful, but I find it [highly rewarding|very good|hint:Adjective].
</FillBlanks>

**Question:** "Do you prefer home-cooked food or eating out?"
**Extension Strategy:** Compare + Reason.

<FillBlanks>
To be honest, I generally prefer home-cooked meals because they are healthier. However, [once in a blue moon|sometimes|hint:Idiom], I enjoy dining out as a treat.
</FillBlanks>

# 🏛️ Lesson 22: The Storyteller – Speaking Part 2 (The Long Turn)

**Topic:** *The 2-Minute Monologue (Cue Card)*.
**Exam Relevance:** You get a topic card (e.g., "Describe a gift you received"). You have 1 minute to prepare and 2 minutes to speak.
**The Trap:** Running out of things to say after 45 seconds.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "PPF" Strategy

To fill 2 minutes, you must move through time.

1. **Past:** Context. When did it happen? What was the situation before?
2. **Present:** Description. What is happening? Details (Senses: look, feel).
3. **Future:** Reflection. How do you feel about it now? Will you keep it?

**The "W" List:** Who, What, Where, When, Why... and **How did you feel?** (Emotion adds volume).

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Note-Taking (1 Minute)

**Topic:** *Describe a difficult challenge you overcame.*

**Bad Notes:** *Math exam. Hard. Passed. Happy.* (Too simple).
**Band 8 Notes:**

* *Context:* Final year uni, pressure, stakes high.
* *Action:* Burned midnight oil, tutor, sleepless nights.
* *Result:* Aced it, relieved, proud.
* *Vocab:* "Daunting task", "Perseverance", "Paid off".

**Task:** Fill the gap in the speech.
*"At the time, passing that exam felt like a [daunting task|big job|hint:Collocation]. I had to [burn the midnight oil|study late|hint:Idiom] for weeks. But eventually, my hard work [paid off|worked|hint:Phrasal Verb]."*

# 🏛️ Lesson 23: The Debater – Speaking Part 3 (Abstract)

**Topic:** *Speaking Part 3 (Discussion)*.
**Exam Relevance:** This is the C1 test. The examiner asks abstract questions linked to Part 2.

* *Part 2 Topic:* A Gift.
* *Part 3 Question:* "Does commercialism destroy the spirit of gift-giving?"

**Goal:** Give a "mini-essay" answer.
**Structure:** **A.R.E.**

1. **A - Answer:** Direct opinion.
2. **R - Reason:** Why?
3. **E - Example:** General example (not personal).

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: Moving from Personal to General

In Part 1/2, you say "I". In Part 3, you say "People / Society".

* **Part 1:** "I like buying expensive gifts."
* **Part 3:** "Many people believe that the monetary value of a gift reflects the strength of the relationship, which is a materialistic viewpoint."

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Abstract Answers

**Question:** "Do you think technology makes people lazy?"
**Answer using A.R.E.:**

**Answer:**
<FillBlanks>
To a certain extent, yes. I believe that reliance on gadgets has reduced our physical activity.
</FillBlanks>

**Reason:**
<FillBlanks>
This is mainly because [we no longer need to|people don't have to|hint:Reason] perform manual tasks, such as washing clothes by hand or walking to shops.
</FillBlanks>

* *Fix:* Focus on **education** (Abstract noun = No article).
