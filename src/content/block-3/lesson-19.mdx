# 🏛️ Lesson 19: The Strategist – Essay Types & Structures (Task 2)

**Topic:** *The 4 Main Essay Types*.
**Exam Relevance:** If you use an "Opinion Essay" structure for a "Problem/Solution" question, you will lose points for Task Response. You must identify the type instantly.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The 4 Archetypes

1. **Opinion (Agree/Disagree):** *To what extent do you agree?*
* **Structure:** Intro (Thesis) -> Body 1 (Reason 1) -> Body 2 (Reason 2) -> Conclusion. (One-sided argument is safer for Band 8).


2. **Discussion (Discuss both views):** *Discuss both views and give your opinion.*
* **Structure:** Intro -> Body 1 (View A) -> Body 2 (View B + Your Opinion) -> Conclusion.


3. **Problem / Solution:** *What are the causes and what measures can be taken?*
* **Structure:** Intro -> Body 1 (Causes) -> Body 2 (Solutions) -> Conclusion.


4. **Two-Part Question:** *Why is this happening? Is it a positive trend?*
* **Structure:** Intro -> Body 1 (Answer Question 1) -> Body 2 (Answer Question 2) -> Conclusion.



**Crucial Rule:** The Introduction and Conclusion must mirror each other. If you change your opinion in the conclusion, you lose Coherence points.
