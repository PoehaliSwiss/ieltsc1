Welcome to **Block 4: Full Exam Simulations**.

You have the tools. Now you need the **stamina**.
In this block, we simulate the pressure of the real exam. The goal is not just to get the answer right, but to get it right **under time pressure**.

# 🏛️ Lesson 25: The Time Lord – Reading Simulation

**Topic:** *Full Reading Strategy & Time Management*.
**Exam Relevance:** You have 60 minutes for 40 questions. That is **1.5 minutes per question**. If you get stuck on one question for 3 minutes, you fail the test.
**The Golden Rule:** **Move On.** If you don't find the answer in 60 seconds, guess and move on.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "20-20-20" Myth

Many teachers say "Spend 20 minutes on Passage 1, 20 on Passage 2, 20 on Passage 3."
**This is wrong.**
Passage 3 is much harder than Passage 1.

**The Band 8 Strategy:**

* **Passage 1:** 15 Minutes (Speed run).
* **Passage 2:** 20 Minutes.
* **Passage 3:** 25 Minutes (Deep focus).

## 2. ⚔️ Simulation: Passage 3 Difficulty (Academic Argument)

**Text Segment:** *The Philosophy of Art.*

> While classical aesthetics focused on the mimicry of nature, modernism abruptly severed this tie. It posited that art should not reflect reality but rather reconstruct it through the artist's subjective lens. Critics of modernism, such as Greenberg, argued that this shift led to a dangerous detachment from the human experience. Conversely, proponents like Adorno suggested that only through abstraction could art truly critique the fractured nature of modern society.

**Questions 1-3: Yes / No / Not Given**

**1. Modernism emphasizes the exact copying of the natural world.**
<Hint>
* *Scan:* "Modernism... abruptly severed this tie [mimicry of nature]".
* *Logic:* Severed = Cut/Stopped.
* *Answer:* **NO**.
</Hint>
**2. Greenberg believed that modernism brought art closer to human emotion.**
<Hint>
* *Scan:* Greenberg -> "dangerous detachment from the human experience".
* *Logic:* Detachment = Moving away.
* *Answer:* **NO**.
</Hint>
**3. Adorno and Greenberg agreed on the role of abstraction.**
<Hint>
* *Scan:* Adorno -> "Conversely" (Contrast word). Greenberg criticized; Adorno was a proponent.
* *Logic:* They disagreed.
* *Answer:* **NO**. (Wait, did the text say they disagreed *specifically* on "abstraction"? Text says Adorno suggested abstraction... Greenberg argued about detachment. The text implies disagreement on the *value* of modernism, but does it explicitly say Greenberg *hated* abstraction? "Conversely" suggests opposing views. Greenberg criticized the *shift*. Adorno supported *abstraction*. It's a contradiction).
* *Correction:* Let's look closer. Greenberg criticized the *shift*. Adorno supported the *abstraction*. One is a critic, one is a proponent. So they do **not** agree. The statement says they "agreed". So the answer is **NO**.
**Wait, let's check the "Not Given" trap.**
Does the text say Greenberg talked about "abstraction"? It says he talked about "this shift". We assume the shift includes abstraction.
*Actually, strictly speaking:* The text contrasts their *views on modernism*. It does not explicitly state Greenberg's specific view on the word "abstraction," only "this shift."
*IELTS Logic:* "Conversely" links Adorno (Pro-Abstraction) against Greenberg (Anti-Shift). The opposition is clear. Answer: **NO**.
</Hint>

**4. Adorno believed art should fix society.**
<Hint>
* *Scan:* Adorno -> "critique the fractured nature".
* *Logic:* "Critique" (Criticize) is NOT "Fix" (Repair).
* *Answer:* **NOT GIVEN**. (He wanted to critique it; the text doesn't say he wanted to *fix* it).
</Hint>
