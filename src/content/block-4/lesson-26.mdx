# 🏛️ Lesson 26: The Sniper – Listening Simulation

**Topic:** *Section 3 & 4 (Academic Focus)*.
**Exam Relevance:** You hear the audio **once**. You must read the questions **before** the audio starts.

## 1. ⚔️ Simulation: Section 3 (Multiple Speakers)

**Context:** Three students (Alice, Bob, Tutor) discussing a project.
**Task:** Multiple Choice.

**Question:** What does the Tutor suggest they do next?
A) Reduce the scope of the project.
B) Interview more participants.
C) Change the research methodology.

**Script:**

> **Alice:** "We have too much data. We interviewed 50 people, but we can't analyze it all in time."
> **Bob:** "Maybe we should just pick the first 20?"
> **Tutor:** "I wouldn't advise that; it makes your sample random. Look, the topic is huge. You're trying to cover the whole city. Why not focus solely on the downtown area? That way, your 50 interviews are actually sufficient."
> **Alice:** "Oh, I see. Narrowing it down. Yes, let's do that."

</Quiz>

## 2. ⚔️ Simulation: Section 4 (Monologue - Diagram Labeling)

**Context:** A lecture on "Desalination Plants".

**Task:** Label the diagram.

**Question:** The water is forced through a __________.

**Script:**

<AudioPhrase hideText='true'> So, how does the reverse osmosis work? First, the seawater enters the chamber under high pressure. It is pushed against a semi-permeable **membrane**, which acts as a filter. The salt molecules are trapped, while the pure water passes through.</AudioPhrase>
