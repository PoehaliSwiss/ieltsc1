# 🏛️ Lesson 29: The Orator – Speaking Simulation

**Topic:** *Full Speaking Test (11-14 Mins)*.

## ⚔️ Part 1: Warm-up (Home)

**Examiner:** "Do you live in a house or an apartment?"
**You (Band 8 Extension):**
"I currently reside in a small apartment in the city center. It’s quite compact, but it's **conveniently located** near my workplace, which saves me a lot of commuting time."

## ⚔️ Part 2: Cue Card

**Topic:** *Describe a piece of technology you find difficult to use.*
**Notes (1 Min):**

* *What:* New Smart Coffee Machine.
* *Why:* Too many buttons, connects to WiFi (why??).
* *Incident:* Woke up, wanted coffee, machine updated firmware. Frustrated.
* *Vocab:* "Over-engineered", "Counter-intuitive", "Steep learning curve".

**The Speech (Snippet):**
"I’d like to talk about my new coffee machine, which I honestly find **baffling**. It's a classic case of something being **over-engineered**. Instead of a simple on-switch, it has a touchscreen interface that is highly **counter-intuitive**. Ideally, I just want caffeine in the morning, but this machine requires me to navigate three menus just to get an espresso."

## ⚔️ Part 3: Abstract Discussion

**Examiner:** "Do you think older people struggle more with technology?"
**You (A.R.E. Structure):**

* **Answer:** Generally speaking, yes.
* **Reason:** They didn't grow up with the intuitive logic of touchscreens (Digital Immigrants vs Natives).
* **Example:** My grandmother trying to use a smartphone.

**Draft:**
It is [generally accepted|hint:Hedging] that the older generation faces a steeper learning curve. This is primarily because they are 'digital immigrants' who are learning a new language, whereas younger people are 'digital natives'. [For instance|hint:Linker], swiping and pinching a screen feels unnatural to someone used to physical buttons.
