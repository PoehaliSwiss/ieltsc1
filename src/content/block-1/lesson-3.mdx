# 🏛️ Lesson 3: The Lexical Upgrade – Academic Collocations

**Topic:** *Lexical Resource (LR)*.
**Exam Relevance:** IELTS examiners look for **Collocations** (words that naturally go together). A Band 6 student translates word-for-word. A Band 8 student uses "chunks."

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "Adjective + Noun" Power Pairs

Stop using "Good," "Bad," "Big," and "Small." They are empty words.
In C1 Academic English, we specify the *nature* of the problem or benefit.

* Instead of "Big difference" -> **Marked contrast / Distinct difference**.
* Instead of "Bad effect" -> **Detrimental impact / Adverse consequence**.
* Instead of "Important part" -> **Integral component / Vital aspect**.

<Flashcards items={[
{word: "To alleviate poverty", wordTranslation: "To reduce poverty", phrase: "The new policy aims to alleviate poverty.", phraseTranslation: "It aims to make poverty less severe."},
{word: "To implement measures", wordTranslation: "To start/do rules", phrase: "The government must implement strict measures.", phraseTranslation: "The government must start strict rules."},
{word: "A feasible solution", wordTranslation: "A possible/doable solution", phrase: "Recycling is a feasible solution.", phraseTranslation: "Recycling is a doable solution."},
{word: "Inextricably linked", wordTranslation: "Connected forever", phrase: "Health and diet are inextricably linked.", phraseTranslation: "You cannot separate health and diet."},
{word: "Mitigating factors", wordTranslation: "Things that make it less bad", phrase: "There were several mitigating factors.", phraseTranslation: "There were reasons why it wasn't so bad."}

## 3. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Collocation Surgery

### Drill 1: Fix the Band 6 Sentence

Replace the bold words with C1 collocations.

**1. "We need to fix the big traffic problem."**
<FillBlanks>
We need to [address|resolve|tackle|hint:Academic verb for 'fix'] the [severe|acute|pressing|hint:Academic adjective for 'big/bad'] traffic congestion.
</FillBlanks>

**2. "This idea has some bad points."**
<FillBlanks>

</FillBlanks>

**3. "He did a crime."**

</FillBlanks>

### Drill 2: Matching

Match the verb to the noun to create a strong collocation.

<Matching pairs={[
{left: "To pose", right: "a threat"},
{left: "To play", right: "a pivotal role"},
{left: "To bridge", right: "the gap"},
{left: "To distort", right: "the truth"},
{left: "To foster", right: "innovation"}

### Drill 3: Contextual Writing

Write one sentence about **"Climate Change"** using the following three collocations:

1. *Irreversible damage*
2. *Take action*
3. *Immediate attention*

*Draft:*
<FillBlanks>
