We continue with **Block 1: The C1 Toolbox**.

To get a Band 7.5+, your writing must flow like a river, not like a robot walking down stairs. This brings us to the most misunderstood criteria: **Coherence & Cohesion**.

---

# 🏛️ Lesson 4: The Glue – Organic Cohesion & Referencing

**Topic:** *Coherence & Cohesion (CC) - Moving beyond "Firstly, Secondly"*.
**Exam Relevance:** Band 6 students use "mechanical linkers" (*First, Second, Furthermore, Also*) at the start of every sentence. Band 8 students use **Referencing** and **Mid-sentence linkers**.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "This + Noun" Strategy

The most powerful tool for cohesion is **Referencing**. Instead of repeating a word or using a basic pronoun ("it"), use a demonstrative pronoun + a summary noun.

* **Bad (Repetitive):** "Pollution is rising. Pollution is bad."
* **Better (Band 6):** "Pollution is rising. **It** is bad."
* **Band 8 (Referencing):** "Pollution is rising. **This alarming trend** is having negative consequences."

**Common "Summary Nouns" for Referencing:**

* *This trend / This development / This phenomenon* (for changes).
* *This view / This perspective / This notion* (for opinions).
* *This measure / This approach / This strategy* (for solutions).
* *This issue / This challenge / This obstacle* (for problems).

## 2. 📘 Deep Theory: Participle Clauses as Linkers

Instead of starting a new sentence with "As a result...", attach the result to the previous sentence using an **-ing clause**.

* **Band 6:** "The government raised taxes. As a result, consumption fell."
* **Band 8:** "The government raised taxes, **resulting in** a fall in consumption."
* **Band 8:** "The factory closed down, **leaving** hundreds unemployed."

## 3. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Cohesion Drills

### Drill 1: The "This + Noun" Transformation

**Task:** Connect the two sentences using *This + Summary Noun*.

**1. "Many people are becoming addicted to social media. The addiction is destroying their social skills."**
<FillBlanks>

<FillBlanks>
Some people argue that prison doesn't work. [This perspective|This view|This notion|hint:Referencing Phrase] is popular.
</FillBlanks>

### Drill 2: Participle Clause Linking (-ing)

**Task:** Combine the sentences into one C1 sentence using an -ing verb.

**1. "Prices increased. This caused inflation."**
<FillBlanks>
Prices increased, [causing|hint:Participle] inflation.
</FillBlanks>

**2. "He studied hard. He passed the exam." (Start with 'Having')**
