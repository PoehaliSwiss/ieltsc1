# 🏛️ Lesson 10: The Distractor – Matching Headings

**Topic:** *Reading Question Types (Matching Headings)*.

**Exam Relevance:** You have 7 headings and 5 paragraphs. You must find the "Main Idea".

**The Trap:** The text contains **Distractors**. Paragraph A mentions "money". Heading iv mentions "financial costs". But is "money" the *main idea* of Paragraph A, or just a detail?

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: Topic Sentence Identification

The **Main Idea** covers the *entire* paragraph. A **Detail** covers only one sentence.

**Strategy:**

1. Read the Headings first. Underline keywords.
2. Read the **first sentence** of the Paragraph. (80% of the time, the answer is here).
3. If not, read the **last sentence**.
4. Do **not** match individual words. Match the **meaning**.

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Header vs. Detail

**Paragraph:**

> Many people believe that electric cars are the ultimate solution to climate change. However, the production of the lithium batteries required for these vehicles causes significant environmental damage in mining regions. Furthermore, the electricity used to charge them is often generated from coal. Therefore, while they are cleaner on the road, their overall footprint is complex.

<Hint>
**Analysis:**
* *I:* Incorrect. The text mentions benefits ("solution"), but the paragraph focuses on the problems ("However...", "Furthermore...").
* *III:* Incorrect. "Coal" is mentioned as a detail, not the main topic.
* *II:* **Correct.** The paragraph discusses "batteries" and "electricity" (Hidden costs) of "electric cars" (Green transport).
