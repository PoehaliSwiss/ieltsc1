# 🏛️ Lesson 10: The Distractor – Matching Headings

**Topic:** *Reading Question Types (Matching Headings)*.

**Exam Relevance:** You have 7 headings and 5 paragraphs. You must find the "Main Idea".

**The Trap:** The text contains **Distractors**. Paragraph A mentions "money". Heading iv mentions "financial costs". But is "money" the *main idea* of Paragraph A, or just a detail?

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: Topic Sentence Identification

The **Main Idea** covers the *entire* paragraph. A **Detail** covers only one sentence.

**Strategy:**

1. Read the Headings first. Underline keywords.
2. Read the **first sentence** of the Paragraph. (80% of the time, the answer is here).
3. If not, read the **last sentence**.
4. Do **not** match individual words. Match the **meaning**.

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Header vs. Detail

**Paragraph:**

> Many people believe that electric cars are the ultimate solution to climate change. However, the production of the lithium batteries required for these vehicles causes significant environmental damage in mining regions. Furthermore, the electricity used to charge them is often generated from coal. Therefore, while they are cleaner on the road, their overall footprint is complex.

<Quiz answer='2'>
**Possible Headings:**
<Option>
i. *The benefits of electric cars.*
</Option>
<Option>
ii. *Hidden environmental costs of green transport.*
</Option>
<Option>
iii. *Coal mining in modern society.*
</Option>
</Quiz>
<Hint>
**Analysis:**
* *I:* Incorrect. The text mentions benefits ("solution"), but the paragraph focuses on the problems ("However...", "Furthermore...").
* *III:* Incorrect. "Coal" is mentioned as a detail, not the main topic.
* *II:* **Correct.** The paragraph discusses "batteries" and "electricity" (Hidden costs) of "electric cars" (Green transport).

</Hint>
**Task:** Which sentence acts as the "Topic Sentence" summary in the paragraph above?
<Quiz answer="3">
**Select the sentence:**

<Option>Sentence 1 ("Many people believe...")</Option>
<Option>Sentence 2 ("However, the production...")</Option>
<Option>Sentence 4 ("Therefore... their overall footprint is complex.")</Option>
</Quiz>

# 🏛️ Lesson 11: Listening Section 1 & 2 – Precision

**Topic:** *Listening Strategy (Survival & Prediction)*.
**Exam Relevance:**

* **Section 1:** Two speakers (Social). Filling a form. **Trap:** Spelling & Numbers.
* **Section 2:** One speaker (Social). Describing a map or event. **Trap:** Distractors.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "Ghost" Method (Prediction)

You have ~30 seconds before the audio starts. You must **predict** the answer.

* If the gap is: "Total cost: $______", you listen for a **Number**.
* If the gap is: "Name: ______", you listen for **Spelling**.
* If the gap is: "Meeting place: The ______", you listen for a **Noun (Place)**.

**The Correction Trap (Review):**
As learned in Block 3 (previous course structure), beware of: *"It's at 5 PM... oh sorry, no, make that 6 PM."* Always write the **last** value.

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Spelling & Numbers

**Task:** I will simulate the audio script. You write the answer.

**1. Audio:** "My name is Thomson. That's T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N."
