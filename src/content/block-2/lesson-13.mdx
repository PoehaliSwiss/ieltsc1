# 🏛️ Lesson 13: The Categorizer – Reading "Matching Features"

**Topic:** *Reading Question Type: Matching Features (Names to Theories)*.
**Exam Relevance:** You have a box of Names (Researchers/Scientists) and a list of Statements (Theories/Findings). You must match who said what.
**The Trap:** The names appear multiple times in the text. You cannot just look at the first mention.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "Box First" Strategy

Do **not** read the text first.

1. **Scan for the Names:** Go to the text and circle/underline *every* instance of the names in the box. (Look for Capital Letters).
2. **Read around the Name:** Read the sentence *before* and *after* the name. Look for "reporting verbs" (*claimed, argued, discovered, noted*).
3. **Match to Statement:** Find the synonym in the statements list.

**NB:** Some names might be used twice. Some might not be used at all (if the instructions don't say "NB: You may use any letter more than once").

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Matching Scientist to Theory

**List of Researchers:**

A) Dr. H. Smith

B) Prof. J. Doe

**List of Findings:**

1. *Economic models are failing to account for environmental loss.*
2. *Climate change is accelerating faster than predicted.*

**Text Segment:**

> ...Initial studies suggested a slow warming trend. However, **Dr. H. Smith** recently published a paper challenging this view. He argued that the rate of ice melt indicates a much more rapid progression of global warming. Meanwhile, **Prof. J. Doe**, an economist, has criticized current financial systems. **Doe** notes that traditional GDP calculations ignore the destruction of natural capital, leading to skewed economic data.

**Task:** Match the Finding to the Researcher.

<Matching pairs={[{"left":"1","right":"B"},{"left":"2","right":"A"}]} />
<Hint>
**Analysis for Finding 1:**

* *Keyword:* "Accelerating faster".
* *Scan Text:* **Smith** -> "much more rapid progression".
* *Match:* 1 = B.

**Analysis for Finding 2:**

* *Keyword:* "Economic models failing".
* *Scan Text:* **Doe** -> "GDP calculations ignore destruction".
* *Match:* 2 = A.
