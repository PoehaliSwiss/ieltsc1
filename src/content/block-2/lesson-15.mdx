**Homework for Block 2:**

1. **The Podcast Challenge:** Listen to a TED Talk (approx. 6 mins). Do NOT look at the transcript. After it finishes, write down the **Main Idea** and **3 Specific Details**.
2. **The "Not Given" Hunt:** Find an IELTS Reading practice test. Do specifically the T/F/NG section. For every "Not Given" answer, explain *why* it is missing (e.g., "Text mentions fruit, Question mentions apples - too specific").
