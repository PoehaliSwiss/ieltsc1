# 🏛️ Lesson 9: The Logic Killer – True / False / Not Given

**Topic:** *Reading Question Types (T/F/NG & Y/N/NG)*.

**Exam Relevance:** This is where Band 8 students lose points. The logic is strict.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The Binary Choice

You are acting like a lawyer in a court. You have **Evidence (The Text)** and a **Statement (The Question)**.

* **TRUE (YES):** The statement agrees with the information in the text 100%. (Synonyms are used).
* **FALSE (NO):** The statement **contradicts** the text. (Text says "Black", Question says "White").
* **NOT GIVEN:** The information is **missing**. You cannot prove it true, and you cannot prove it false.

**The "Not Given" Trap:**
The text might mention the *topic*, but not the specific *fact* in the question.

* *Text:* "The car is expensive."
* *Statement:* "The car is fast."
* *Verdict:* **NOT GIVEN**. (Expensive cars are usually fast, but the text didn't *say* it. Do not assume!).

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: The Logic Test

**Text:**

> While most spiders are solitary creatures, the *Anelosimus eximius* lives in colonies of up to several thousand individuals. These social spiders work together to build massive webs and share the prey they catch.

**Statement 1:** "The *Anelosimus eximius* is the only spider that lives in groups."
<Quiz answer="3">
**Verdict?**

<Option>True</Option>
<Option>False</Option>
<Option>Not Given</Option>
</Quiz>
<Hint>
(Text says they live in groups. It does NOT say they are the *only* ones. Maybe others exist? We don't know.)
</Hint>
**Statement 2:** "Social spiders share their food."
<Quiz answer="1">
**Verdict?**

<Option>True</Option>
<Option>False</Option>
<Option>Not Given</Option>
</Quiz>
<Hint>
Text says "share the prey". Prey = Food
</Hint>
**Statement 3:** "Solitary spiders are larger than social spiders."
<Quiz answer="3">
**Verdict?**

<Option>True</Option>
<Option>False</Option>
<Option>Not Given</Option>
</Quiz>
<Hint>
Text compares social behavior, not size. The word "massive" describes the *webs*, not the spiders.
</Hint>
