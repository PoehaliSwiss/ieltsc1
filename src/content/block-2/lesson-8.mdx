Welcome to **Block 2: Receptive Mastery (Reading & Listening)**.

Most students stay at Band 6.5 in Reading because they try to **read** the texts.
To get a Band 8+, you must stop reading. You must start **hunting**.

The IELTS Reading test is 60 minutes for ~2,500 words. You do not have time to appreciate the literature. You need **speed** and **logic**.

# 🏛️ Lesson 8: The Hunter’s Eyes – Skimming vs. Scanning

**Topic:** *Reading Strategy Fundamentals*.
**Exam Relevance:** You need to process information at two different speeds. If you read everything at the same speed, you will run out of time.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The Two Gears

### Gear 1: Skimming (For Gist)

**Goal:** To understand the *structure* and *main idea*.

**When:** Before looking at the questions (optional, but recommended for 1 min) or for "Matching Headings" tasks.

**Method:** Read the **Title**, the **First Sentence** of every paragraph, and the **Last Sentence** of every paragraph. Ignore the middle.

### Gear 2: Scanning (For Detail)

**Goal:** To find a specific word or answer.

**When:** For "Completion" tasks, T/F/NG, or Multiple Choice.

**Method:** Your eyes move in a zig-zag pattern. You are looking for **Keywords** (Numbers, Names, Capital Letters, or Synonyms of the question). You do *not* read the text; you look for the shape of the word.

## 2. 🛠️ Mega Practice: Speed Drills

### Drill 1: Skimming (Identify the Topic)

**Task:** Read ONLY the first and last sentence of this paragraph. What is the main idea?

> The introduction of the cane toad to Australia is widely considered one of the worst ecological blunders in history. [ ... 8 lines of text about the toad eating beetles and breeding ... ] Consequently, native species have suffered a catastrophic decline in numbers.

<Quiz answer="2">
**What is the paragraph about?**
<Option>How cane toads breed.</Option>
<Option>The negative impact of cane toads on Australia.</Option>
<Option>The diet of the cane toad.</Option>
</Quiz>

<Hint>
**Analysis:** The middle contained details about breeding (Option A/C), but the *First* and *Last* sentences define the **argument** (Ecological blunder -> Catastrophic decline).
</Hint>

### Drill 2: Scanning (Find the Synonym)

**Question:** "The study suggests that **sleep deprivation** affects **cognitive performance**."

**Text:** "...researchers found that subjects who experienced a lack of rest demonstrated a marked reduction in their ability to solve complex problems and recall information..."

**Task:** Find the synonyms in the text for the bold words.

1. **Sleep deprivation** -> ?
2. **Cognitive performance** -> ?

<FillBlanks>

1. Sleep deprivation = [lack of rest|hint:Synonym in text]
2. Cognitive performance = [ability to solve complex problems|ability to solve complex problems and recall information|hint:Synonym phrase]
</FillBlanks>
