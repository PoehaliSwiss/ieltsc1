# 🏛️ Lesson 11: Listening Section 1 & 2 – Precision

**Topic:** *Listening Strategy (Survival & Prediction)*.
**Exam Relevance:**

* **Section 1:** Two speakers (Social). Filling a form. **Trap:** Spelling & Numbers.
* **Section 2:** One speaker (Social). Describing a map or event. **Trap:** Distractors.

## 1. 📘 Deep Theory: The "Ghost" Method (Prediction)

You have ~30 seconds before the audio starts. You must **predict** the answer.

* If the gap is: "Total cost: $______", you listen for a **Number**.
* If the gap is: "Name: ______", you listen for **Spelling**.
* If the gap is: "Meeting place: The ______", you listen for a **Noun (Place)**.

**The Correction Trap (Review):**
As learned in Block 3 (previous course structure), beware of: *"It's at 5 PM... oh sorry, no, make that 6 PM."* Always write the **last** value.

## 2. 🛠️ Practice: Spelling & Numbers

**Task:** I will simulate the audio script. You write the answer.

**1. Audio:** 
<AudioPhrase hideText='true'>My name is Thomson. That's T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.</AudioPhrase>
**Gap:** Name: Mr. __________
<FillBlanks>
[Thompson|hint:Watch out for the silent 'P']
</FillBlanks>

**2. Audio:** 
<AudioPhrase hideText='true'>The flight number is A-C-9-3-2... correction, A-C-9-4-2.</AudioPhrase>
**Gap:** Flight: __________
<FillBlanks>
[AC942|AC 942|hint:Did you catch the correction?]
</FillBlanks>

**3. Audio:** 
<AudioPhrase hideText='true'>
It costs 15 pounds... wait, with the discount it's only 15 dollars.
</AudioPhrase>
**Gap:** Cost: __________
<FillBlanks>
[$15|15 dollars|hint:Watch the currency!]
</FillBlanks>

# 🏛️ Homework for Lessons 8-11

1. **Reading T/F/NG:** Go to an IELTS practice site. Do *only* the True/False/Not Given questions for one passage. Your goal: 100% accuracy. If you get one wrong, analyze: Did I miss a synonym? Or did I assume information (Not Given)?
2. **Listening Spelling:** Ask a friend (or use a generator) to spell 10 difficult street names or numbers rapidly. Write them down. You cannot afford to lose points in Section 1.
3. **Vocabulary Mining:** Find a text about "Space Exploration." Skim it in 2 minutes. Write down the "Gist" (Main Idea) in one sentence.
